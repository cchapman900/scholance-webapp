# Auth0 Angular Custom Login Form

This sample demonstrates how to add authentication with a custom login form to an Angular application using Auth0. The sample uses the Angular CLI.

## Getting Started

If you haven't already done so, [sign up](https://auth0.com) for your free Auth0 account and create a new client in the [dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com). Find the **domain** and **client ID** from the settings area and add the URL for your application to the **Allowed Callback URLs** box. If you are using the server provided by the Angular CLI, that URL is `http://localhost:4200`.

Make sure you have Angular CLI installed

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Clone the repo, change directories into `auth0-angular-samples`, switch to the `embedded-login` branch, and change directories into `01-Embedded-Login`. Then install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-angular-samples.git
cd auth0-angular-samples
git checkout embedded-login
cd 02-Custom-Login
npm install
```

## Set the Client ID and Domain 

To configure the application for your Auth0 account settings, rename the `auth0-variables.ts` file to `auth0-variables.ts` and provide the **client ID** and **domain** there. This file is located in `src/app/auth/`.

## Using Cross Origin Authentication

When the user and password are entered in an embedded login form, a cross-origin call is made. Please read the [Cross Origin Authentication documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/cross-origin-authentication) in order to better understand how to configure it and its limitations.

Make sure you edit the contents of the `src/callback-cross-auth.html` file to match your Client Id, Domain and Callback settings. This page will only be used when third-party cookies are disabled in the client browser, and needs to be served over HTTPS. Note that when third-party cookies are disabled, there are some browsers where the authentication flow will NOT work unless you use [Custom Domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains).

## Run the Application

The development server that comes with the Angular CLI can be used to serve the application.

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be served at `http://localhost:4200`.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).

## Create a free Auth0 account
